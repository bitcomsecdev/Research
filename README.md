# [BITCOMSEC] The Bitcoin Community Security Project
=================

BITCOMSEC is a project run by dedicated researchers who stride in bringing security awareness to the Bitcoin community. Besides performing security audits for exchanges, pools and merchants we also focus on core security issues that affect the community at whole.

This repository will contain research that will not be limited to the Bitcoin community. It may contain security research that focuses on open source software and security incidents that we are investigating.
